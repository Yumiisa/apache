# Question one
### clone the code from github and open in your favourite code editor like vs code
### On VS code download C compiler 
### Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Use the appropriate command based on your C compiler to compile the code.
### run the program and observe output on terminal for example ./quiz1

# Question2
# Follow the same step as question 1

## Different method used to implement question 2
## Iteration (Loop):

### Advantages: Simple to implement, does not require additional function calls or memory usage for recursion or memoization.
### Disadvantages: May be slower for larger values of n compared to the other methods due to repeated calculations.

## Recursion:

### Advantages: Reflects the mathematical definition of the recurrence relation, easier to understand and reason about.
### Disadvantages: May result in redundant calculations for larger values of n, leading to inefficiency and stack overflow for very large inputs.

## Dynamic Programming (Memoization):

### Advantages: Avoids redundant calculations by storing intermediate results in memory, leading to improved performance for larger values of n.
### Disadvantages: Requires additional memory to store the memoization table, may have slightly higher overhead due to function calls and memory access.
